Good practices to keep this repo nice and concise:

- Feel free to suggest anything you or others would recommend.
- Please, test the tools before suggesting anything.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list,
  argue how it's better.
- Create individual pull requests for each suggestion using the following format:<br>
  `[package](link) - Description. [language, license, repo]`
- Keep it short and simple.
- Search if someone else already suggested your idea before.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Trail whitespaces and check your grammar.
- Include links in your description.
- Create helpful titles for your pull request.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome,
  but should be done in a separate pull request.
